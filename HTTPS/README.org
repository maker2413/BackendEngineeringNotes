#+TITLE: Many ways to HTTPS

This section contains my notes on the "Many ways to HTTPS" chapter of
[[https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-backend-communications-and-protocols/?kw=fundamentals+of+backend+eng&src=sac][Fundamentals of Backend Engineering]] Course.

HTTPS Communication Basics:
- Establish Connection
- Establish Encryption
- Send Data
- Close Connection (when absolutely done)

HTTPS communications:
- HTTPS over TCP with TLS 1.2
- HTTPS over TCP with TLS 1.3
- HTTPS over QUIC
- HTTPS over TCP fast Open
- HTTPS over TCP with TLS 1.3 0RTT
- HTTPS over QUIC with 0RTT

HTTPS over TCP with TLS 1.2:
