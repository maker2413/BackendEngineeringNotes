#+TITLE: TLS

TLS:
- Stands for Transport Layer Security
- Vanilla HTTP
- HTTPS
- TLS 1.2 Handshake (two round trips)
- Diffie Hellman
- TLS 1.3 Improvements (one round trip can be zero)

Why TLS:
- We encrypt with symmetric key algorithms
- We need to exchange the symmetric key
- Key exchange uses asymmetric key (PKI)
- Authenticate the server
- Extensions (SNI, preshared, 0RTT)
