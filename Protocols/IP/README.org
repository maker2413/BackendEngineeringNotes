#+TITLE: Internet Protocol

IP Address:
- Layer 3 property
- Can be set automatically or statically
- Network and Host portion
- 4 bytes in IPv4 - 32 bits

Network vs Host
- a.b.c.d/x (a.b.c.d are integers) x is the network bits and remains are host
- Example 192.168.254.0/24
  - The first 24 bits (3 bytes) are network the other 8 are for the host
  - This means we can have =2^24= (=16777216=) networks and each network has
    =2^8= (=255=) hosts
  - Also called a subnet

Subnet Mask
- 192.168.254.0/24 is also called a subnet
- The subnet mask is: 255.255.255.0
- Subnet mask is used to determine whether an IP is in the same subnet

Default Gateway
- Most networks consists of hosts and a Default Gateway
- When host A can talk to B directly they are both in the same subnet
- Otherwise A sends it to someone who might know, the gateway
- The Gateway has an IP address and each host should know its gateway

The IP Packet
- The IP Packet has headers and data sections
- IP Packet header is 20 bytes (can go up to 60 bytes if options are enabled)
- Data section can go up to 65536

Summary:
- The IP Packet has headers and data sections
- IP Packet is 20 bytes (can go up to 60 bytes if options are enabled)
- Data section can go up to 65535
- Packets need to get fragmented if it doesn't fit in a frame

ICMP:
- Stands for Internet Control Message Protocol
- Designed for informational messages
  - Host unreachable, port unreachable, fragmentation needed
  - Packet expired (infinite loop in routers)
- Uses IP Directly
- ~ping~ and ~traceroute~ use it
- Doesn't require listeners or ports to be opened
- Some firewalls block ICMP for security reasons
- That is why ~ping~ might not work in those cases
- Disabling ICMP also can cause real damage with connection establishment
  - Fragmentation needed

TraceRoute:
- Can you identify the entire path your IP Packet takes?
- Clever use of TTL
- Increment TTL slowly and you will get the router IP address for each hop
- Doesn't always work as path changes and the ICMP might be blocked

Summary:
- ICMP is an IP level protocol used for informational messages
- Critical to know if the host is available or port is opened
- Used for ~ping~ and ~traceroute~
- Can be blocked which can cause problems
