#+TITLE: HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

HTTP/2 Pros and Cons:
Pros:
- Multiplexing over Single Connection (save resources)
- Compression (Headers & Data)
- Server Push
- Secure by default
- Protocol Negotiation during TLS (ALPN)
Cons:
- TCP head of line blocking
- Server Push never picked up
- High CPU usage

TCP head of line blocking:
- TCP segments must be delivered in order
- But streams don't have to
- Blocking requests

HTTP/3 & QUIC
- HTTP/3 uses QUIC
- Like HTTP/2, QUIC has streams
- But QUIC uses UDP instead of TCP
- Application decides the boundary

HTTP/3 & QUIC Pros and Cons:
Pros:
- QUIC has many other benefits
- Merges Connection setup + TLS in one handshake
- Has congestion control at a stream level
- Connection migration (connectionID)
- Why not HTTP/2 over QUIC?
  - Header compression algorithm
Cons:
- Takes a lot of CPU (parsing logic)
- UDP could be blocked
- IP Fragmentation is the enemy
