#+TITLE: Process vs Thread

What is a Process?
- A set of instructions
- Has an isolated section of memory
- Every process has a PID (Process Identity)
- Scheduled in the CPU

What is a Thread?
- Light weight Process (LWP)
- A set of instructions
- Shares memory with it's parent process
- Has an ID
- Scheduled in the CPU

Single Threaded Process:
- One Process with a single thread
- Simple
- Examples NodeJS

Multi-Processes
- App has multiple processes
- Each has it's own memory
- Examples Nginx/PostgreSQL
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- More memory, but isolated
- Redis backup routine (COW)

Multi Threaded Process:
- One Process, multiple threads
- Shared Memory (compete)
- Take advantage of multi-cores
- Require less memory
- Race conditions
- Locks and Latches (SQL Server)
- Examples: Apache, Envoy

How many is too many?
- Too many process/threads is not a good thing
- CPU context switch
- Multiple Cores help
- Rule of thumb -> number of Cores = number of Processes
