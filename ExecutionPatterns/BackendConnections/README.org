#+TITLE: How the Backend Accepts Connections

Connection Establishment:
- TCP Three way handshake
- SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK
- But what happens on the backend
  - Server listens on an address:port
  - Client connects
  - Kernel does the handshake, creating a connection
  - Backend process "Accepts" the connection
  - Kernel creates a socket & two queues SYN and Accept
  - Client sends a SYN
  - Kernel adds this to the SYN queue, replies with SYN/ACK
  - Client replies with ACK
  - Kernel finishes the connection
  - Kernel removes the SYN from the SYN queue
  - Kernel adds full connection to the Accept queue
  - Backend accepts the connection, removed from the Accept queue
  - A file descriptor is created for the connection

Problems with accepting connections:
- Backend doesn't accept connections fast enough
- Clients who don't ACK
- Small backlog
