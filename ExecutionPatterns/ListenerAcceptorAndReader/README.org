What is idempotency?
- API/postcomment
- Takes comment and appends it to the table
- What if the user/proxy retries it?
- You will have duplicate comments
  - Very bad for financial systems
- Idempotent request can be retried without affecting backend
- Easy implementation send a requestId
- If requestId has been processed return
- Also known as idempotency token

Idempotency in HTTP:
- GET is idempotent
- POST isn't, but we can make it
- Browsers and proxies treat GET as idempotent
- Make sure your GETs are idempotent
