#+TITLE: Reading and Sending Socket Data

Send and receive buffers:
- Client sends data on a connection
- Kernel puts data in receive queue
- Kernel ACKs (may delay) and update window
- Application calls to copy the data

Problems with reading and sending:
- Backend doesn't read fast enough
- Receive queue is full
- Client slows down
