#+TITLE: Multiplexing Vs Demultiplexing

If you have multiple requests going into an application and shove this all into
one line of traffic that is called multiplexing. Demultiplexing is the opposite
of this (breaking out that one line of traffic into separate requests).

A simple example of when this happens is with HTTP/2. With HTTP/1.1 there was no
multiplexing so when a user sent multiple requests to a server the server got
each of them all at once.

Connection pooling is another example of multiplexing. Connection pooling is
done by PostgreSQL Database servers.
