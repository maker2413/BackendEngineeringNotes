What is JWT?
- JSON Web Token (JWT)
- Completely Stateless
- 3 Parts: Header, Data, Signature
- Signature encryption can be symmetrical or asymmetrical
- Symmetrically require same key to create JWT and validate
- Asymmetrical private key create JWT, public key validates

Pros and Cons of JWT:
Pros:
- Stateless
- Great for APIs
- Secure
- Carry useful information (username)
- Can store information for centralized database
Cons:
- Sharing secrets in mircoservices architecture
- Key management
- Very tricky to consume correctly
- Storage of Refresh tokens
- Token Revocation and Control
- Insecure implementation (e.g. none alg)
