These are just some notes I took while working through this [[https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-backend-communications-and-protocols/?kw=fundamentals+of+backend+eng&src=sac][Udemy Course]].

- 2. :: [[./Protocols/README.org][Protocols]]
- 3. :: [[./HTTPS/README.org][Many ways to HTTPS]]
- 4. :: [[./ExecutionPatterns/README.org][Backend Execution Patterns]]
